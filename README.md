# To-DoList
A basic todo list to maintain your todos.

Here, you can manage your todos with a transitioning interface. You can add new todos, delete and/or uncheck them using this application. Clicking on any list item checks it as done. You can re-click the item to re-activate it. As you hover over any list item, a delete icon is slided in. Clicking on the delete icon, removes the list item permanently. To add new todos, you can enter the required data in the input and press Enter to add it. The plus icon floating near the heading bar enable/disable the input bar.
